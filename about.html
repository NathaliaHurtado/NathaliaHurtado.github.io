  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <div class="about-section">
    <div>
      <p>Elderly Smiles seeks to bring compassion and companionship to nursing homes—spaces that are often overlooked as places to volunteer. Our mission is to brighten residents’ lives by fostering intergenerational connections, where the presence of young faces reminds them they are valued and cherished. Through one-on-one conversations and engaging activities that support cognitive stimulation, we aim to build meaningful relationships that honor each resident’s story and ensure they feel respected, cared for, and purposeful.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-section" style="flex-direction: row-reverse;">
    <div>
      <p>Hi, I’m Nathalia Hurtado, the founder of Elderly Smiles. I started this project during my junior year of high school after realizing how often nursing homes are overlooked, even though the people who live there have so much wisdom and warmth to share. Being from Venezuela, I’ve experienced what it feels like to be unheard and invisible, and I never want others—especially our elders—to feel that way. Elderly Smiles is my way of building meaningful connections that remind residents they are valued, cared for, and loved. I also hope to pursue a career in neuroscience as a future neurosurgeon and Parkinson’s researcher, with a focus on geriatrics.</p>
